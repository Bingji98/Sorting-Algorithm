# Bubble Sort <a name="bs"></a>
The basic idea of bubble sorting is that it repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they are not in the desired order. **As a result, after the N<sup>th</sup> round, the N<sup>th</sup> largest number will be switched to the last place.**

If a given array of elements has to be sorted in ascending order, bubble sorting will start by comparing the first element of the array with the second element and immediately swap them if it turns out to be greater than the second element, and then move on to compare the second and third element, and so on. Below is an example:
